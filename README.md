# Hey! This is my repo for the project.

## VERY IMPORTANT!

Sadly, I've been unable to do some of the tasks (including the seed-randomized times and localStorage texts).
If you'll rate this assignment >80%, please create an "Issue" in GitHub where you link your assignment, and I'll rate it as well with the same rating as you did.
Thank you, and congratulations on completing the course!
